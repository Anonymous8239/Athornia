Athornia represents him as a dolphin or a horse. He is our god because we believe that if we follow him, he shall grant us good fortune in trading, fishing, and agriculture. Anorther reason we follow him is because of the serpent of the sea myth. Once upon a time there was a serpent in the sea who taunted sailors, and traders. One day an soul beliver of <u>posiden</u>  conjoured him into sea, and the fight began. Posiden ultimatley beat the serpent, with his mythical trident. </p>
